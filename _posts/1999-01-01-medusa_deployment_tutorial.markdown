## Architecture and Requirements
Overview the architecture and requirements for our setup:

- **Backend**: Hosted on Digital Ocean with automatic scaling using the app platform. PostgreSQL is used for the database, Redis for event bus and caching, and S3 spaces for media files.

- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel, leveraging serverless functions for scalability. Stripe is used for payment processing, SendGrid for transactional emails, and MeiliSearch for the search engine.
